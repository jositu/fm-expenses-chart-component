# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

![Design preview for the Expenses chart component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## TODO
- Make chart responsive
- make total amount and spending title dynamic
- Finish README
- Fix desktop and tablet designs
- Fix hover colors for bars
- fix tooltip info display to just $ amount
- Adjust sizing of fonts for "total this month" section
- See if I can put chart js options into less file

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback. 

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
